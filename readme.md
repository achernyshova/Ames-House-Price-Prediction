## Problem Statement
> - The goal for this project use linear regression techniques in order to estimate the sales price of houses in Ames, Iowa.

## Dataset
 > - Dataset from Kaggle Competition
 > - Dataset contains house sale prices and its features for houses
sold in Ames between January 2006 and July 2010
 > - 2930 observations in dataset
 > - 81 attributes - nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous

## Executive Summary
The project will do the following parts:
1. Cleaning the Train and Test datasets
2. Doing an EDA
3. Features engineering
4. Building and fitting the model
5. Evaluating the model


## Conclusions and findings
This competition was a great exercise in some regression techniques. I was able to achieve a top 30% score even though I performed minimal feature engineering, which I will leave as a later exercise for myself.

The model that performs the best was is which got me in the top 30% on Kaggle competition and 1st place in in-class competition is stacking model (Lasso, Ridge, Enet, XGBoost) with R2 Score 95%
